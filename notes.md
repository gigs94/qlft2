A few notes:

·   Read the problem description carefully
·   Please time box this to ~6-10 hours, as you see fit. Document your time spent with your submission.
·   We value good design and construction with easy opportunities for enhancement and extension
      o   Do not spend hours & hours bit-packing to get better compression
      o   Don’t bother re-implementing Huffman encoding or some other available compression algorithm
·   Document your design and your algorithm with your submission. Show us you can discuss and explain what you did and why.

 

Pay close attention to the evaluation factors, in order, as discussed in the attachment.

·         Design & Construction
·         Tests
·         Correctness
·         Analysis and Documentation
·         Compression ratio
·         Performance
